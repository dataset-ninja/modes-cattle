**MoDES: Monocular Depth Estimation and Segmentation Dataset of Stray Animals** is a dataset for monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the educational domain. 

The dataset consists of 800000 images with 800000 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cattle*). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, depth masks and rgb images were grouped by their ***image_id***. The dataset was released in 2020.
